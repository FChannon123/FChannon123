## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Francesca Channon, a PhD student at University College London (UCL), specialising in Artificial Intelligence with a focus on energy efficiency in the built environment. My research is supervised by Professor John Shawe-Taylor and Professor Tomaso Aste, and I am a Windsor Fellowship Scholar sponsored by PGIM Real Estate. I have a strong background in AI, statistics, and pure mathematics with additional expertise in financial mathematics, and biosciences and biotechnology.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- **Research Universe**: An AI-driven tool designed to enhance research accessibility, analysis, and visualisation of research focusing on Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and Artificial Intelligence. This tool integrates large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs to enable researchers to explore and analyse complex datasets in an intuitive 3D interactive environment. The goal is to streamline the discovery of research gaps and promote further academic inquiry.
- **AI and HVAC Systems**: Applying AI to optimise energy efficiency in HVAC systems, focusing on research trends, data analytics, and intelligent automation.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Advanced AI techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), transformer models, LLM fine-tuning, and LLM-knowledge graph integration.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
- Projects involving AI applications for sustainability, energy-efficient systems, and large-scale data analytics.
- Open-source initiatives focused on integrating AI and LLMs with knowledge graphs for enhanced complex data understanding.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
- Collaborators who are interested in the intersection of AI, HVAC systems, and environmental sustainability.
- Contributions to **Research Universe**, particularly in KG construction, LLM-KG integration, and finetuning.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
- AI applications in energy efficiency within the sustainable built environment.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs.

### Projects and Research Interests:

- **Research Universe**: [Project Overview](https://github.com/YourGitHub/Research-Universe)
    - Developing in collaboration with AI entrepreneur Elton Sampaio, the tool is designed to help researchers explore, analyse, and visualise research related to HVAC systems and AI.
    - The project involves natural language processing, knowledge graphs, interactive 3D visualisations, and querying of AI and HVAC research databases.

- **Energy Efficiency in Built Environments**:
    - Focused on optimising energy consumption in buildings using AI, machine learning, and predictive analytics.
    - Supervised by leading AI experts at UCL, I am working on creating scalable AI-driven solutions for real-world energy management problems.
